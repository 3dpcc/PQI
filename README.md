# Revisit Point Cloud Quality Assessment: Current Advances and a Multiscale-Inspired Approach

## ✨ Introduction

LiDAR point cloud compression (PCC) is essential for networked machinery, e.g., autonomous vehicles and robotics, to cache and exchange high-precision positioning data for perception. Existing methods, including volumetric- and octree-based approaches, are limited by insufficient retrieval of correlated neighboring points for effective context modeling. This paper introduces MuDAR, a multi-dimensional context mining-based LiDAR PCC, which jointly exploits correlations by gathering proximate neighbors from multi-dimensional spaces, including an octree-structured 1D array, a LiDAR scanning-related 2D map, and a Cartesian coordinates indexed 3D spatial tensor, for more accurate and efficient context modeling. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of MuDAR. On average, it attains 43\% and 47\% compression gains over the standardized G-PCC in static and dynamic coding modes, respectively, across four widely used LiDAR datasets.
